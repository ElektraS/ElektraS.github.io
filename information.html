				Earth is the third planet from the sun at a distance of about 150 million km (93 million miles) or one AU. Moreover, the Earth's atmosphere is made up of 78 percent nitrogen (N2), 21 percent oxygen (O2) and 1 percent other ingredients -- the perfect balance for us to breathe and live. Many planets have atmospheres, but only Earth's is breathable.</br>
				Earth has one moon. Another name for a moon is satellite.

On the contrary of the previous planet which are rocky planets, Jupiter is a gas-giant planet. Therefore it does not have a solid surface. However, it is predicted that Jupiter has an inner, solid core about the size of the Earth.Many missions have visited Jupiter and its system of moons. The Juno mission will arrive at Jupiter in 2016.
				Jupiter is the name of master of gods.

Neptune is mostly made of a very thick, very hot combination of water (H2O), ammonia (NH3), and methane (CH4) over a possible heavier, approximately Earth-sized, solid core. It has 6 rings. Moreover Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune. Neptune is the sea god.</div>
